# Feature Timeline

## MVP's
  ### Users can search questions.
  ### Users can see questions and answers.
  ### Users can filter questions by type and company.

## Users
  ### Users can log in.
  ### Users can track progress with different categories.
      --> How is this going to work? Users hold an array of question keys which they've marked as done?
      --> But the keys for the questions are randomly generated, which could be an issue.

## CMS
  ### Add update ability to questions for admins.
  
## Quizes
  ### Users can take quizes. 
  ### Quizzes are random, category based, or company based. 

## Tracks
  ### i.e. Front End Track is HTML, HTTP, CSS, JS, etc. 

## Forever Evolving:
  ### Intuitive (and pretty!) UI 
  ### Organization of 'all questions'.
    - Alternatively, I could make the landing page have cards with subjects on it, and not list the questions until you pick a category.
